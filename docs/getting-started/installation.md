# Installation

:::info[Important]

Sprouty Dialogs requires **Godot 4.5** or higher!

:::

## Install from Github

For install the plugin from Github follow these instructions:

1. Download the `zip` file from [Github Releases](https://github.com/SproutyLabs/SproutyDialogs/releases) (recommended) or from the [main branch in Github](https://github.com/SproutyLabs/SproutyDialogs).

:::note

if you want to use the main branch for features or fixes that have not yet been released, click on the green `Code` button and then in `Download ZIP`.

:::

2. Extract the `addons` folder from the `zip` file. There is a `sprouty-dialogs` folder that contains the plugin.
3. Move the `addons` folder to the root of your project, or if you already have an `addons` folder, only move the `sprouty-dialogs` folder inside it.
4. If you have this path `"res://addons/sprouty-dialogs"` in your project, you succesfully added Sprouty Dialogs to your project! Now you need to activate the plugin in Godot.

Now that you have the plugin in your project, you need to activate it to start use it.

1. Go to **Project > Project Settings**.
2. Click on `Plugins` tab.
