### What's Changed

---

- Allow to open the dialogue and character files with the plugin when selecting it from Godot's file system
- Now you don't need to connect the nodes in order 😅, the propagation of the dialog ID between connected nodes was fixed.
- Solved a bug where the default portrait does not load when running the dialog, now it's loading them properly.
- Solved a bug where the character references were not saved in unplugged dialogue nodes, now it's saving them properly.
- Solved some UI and CSV file bugs when you change the translation settings with open files.
- And some other bugs fixes, that you can check here [#5](https://github.com/SproutyLabs/SproutyDialogs/pull/5)
